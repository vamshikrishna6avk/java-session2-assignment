Difference between Compiler and Interpreter


Compiler :
	Compiler is a software which checks the source code and list all the errors .
	Compiler doesn't allow to run a program until the errors are completely removed.
	It converts source code into machine code .
	Compile the  program once and it  can be run anytime .
Interpreter:
	Interpreter works line by line ,it takes one statement at a time as an input.
	Programs are interpreted by line every time they are run.
	Error is reported as soon as the first error occured ,the rest of the program will not be checked until the error is completly removed
